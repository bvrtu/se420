In recent years, many successful applications of machine learning have been developed, ranging from data-mining programs that learn to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, to autonomous vehicles that learn to drive on public highways. At the same time, there have been important advances in the theory and algorithms that form the foundation of this field. The goal of this course is to provide an overview of the state-of-art algorithms used in machine learning. Both the theoretical properties of these algorithms and their practical applications will be discussed.",
          "description": "Machine learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance with past experiences. Machine learning draws inspiration from many fields, artificial intelligence, statistics, information theory, biology and control theory. The course will cover the following topics; computational learning theory, machine learning concepts, Bayesian learning, supervised learning, classification methods, regression methods, unsupervised learning, clustering methods, artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning, and discussion of advanced machine learning methods.",

Although the course provides a broad view of the operating system, it mostly focuses on Bash programming and system administration. Students will get a handson approach on using and programming the operating system commands and scripts and will become very familiar with the UNIX environment. This course requires an understanding of modern operating systems and a working knowledge of programming basics. Students will be asked to work on a substantial Bash programming project and will need to develop good technical writing skills and programming skills.",

Music and Computer Science are getting more closely linked each day. Live music performances and modern media applications involve computer technology, from recording studios, synthesizers, and samplers to 3-dimensional controllers for manipulating sounds of all kind. Especially, computers and related software are widely used in producing music recordings: music for film, advertisements, and for video games. Both acoustic and sampled instruments and synthesized sound sources are used to produce some of these music pieces. Therefore, we will focus on these issues in this course.",

Sound characteristics such as amplitude and frequency. Sound analysis techniques and visualizing sounds. Recording techniques: essential components used in the music production process. Sound synthesis and computer music: digital signal processing and sound generation techniques. Sound editing techniques: components of sound editing. Stages of sound to microphone, from microphone to computer, and then back to speakers. Analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital to analog converters (DAC). Mixing board and mixing process.",

They will learn about the concept of arbitrage, and when consideration of such is sufficient to price different investments. Applications to call and put options will be given. Students will learn when arbitrage arguments are not sufficient to evaluate investment opportunities. They will learn to make use of utility theory and mathematical optimization models to determine optimal decisions. Dynamic programming will be introduced and used to solve sequential optimization problems. The use of simulation in financial engineering will be explored.",

Students will be exposed to both theoretical lectures and practical design challenges. Students will receive active guidance and support during the development of their game projects by their instructor and other advisors.",

The course starts with a brief recap of classes/objects, methods, encapsulation, input/output, exceptions and the concepts of inheritance, and polymorphism. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java, the use of layout managers and design of event listener objects are introduced. Advanced topics including serialization, XML and JSON data processing, multi-threading, sockets, and database connectivity are discussed. The students are exposed to Junit testing and debugging. The students are expected to complete a project involving the design and implementation of a fairly complex Java program that consists of a GUI and utilizes at least two of the advanced programming areas.",

Each pattern represents a best practice solution to a software problem in some context. The course will sensitize the student that there is rarely one \"right\" design and an engineer is faced with a spectrum of possibilities representing tradeoffs. The course will cover the rationale and benefits of design patterns in architecting software systems. The course includes a brief review of object-oriented design principles and UML. Programming assignments and a project in the Java language will provide experience in the use of these patterns.",

The main focus of the course will be the emergence and the development of social and economic systems, and how these systems have come to shape our contemporary world, by giving emphasis on the European context. Keeping this aim in mind, we will first consider what economic history is (what kind of a discipline it is, how is different from economics, etc.), and then consider what in human history had paved the way to capitalism. The course will be ended with a brief discussion of the contemporary era, in which the process of globalization is said to be prevalent.",

Some of the topics on this course include: economic processes in the ancient world and middle ages, geographical expansion of the Western world, industrial revolution, developments in agriculture, finance, banking sectors during the expansion process of the main European countries, application of technology, developments in telecommunication and transportation, the role of the state, the growth of the world economy and impact of the European industrialized countries on the rest of the world, and the economic developments of the post World War I and II.",

The main focus of the course will be the emergence and the development of social and economic systems, and how these systems have come to shape our contemporary world, by giving emphasis on the European context. Keeping this aim in mind, we will first consider what economic history is (what kind of a discipline it is, how is different from economics, etc.), and then consider what in human history had paved the way to capitalism. The course will be ended with a brief discussion of the contemporary era, in which the process of globalization is said to be prevalent.",

Over time they have given rise to a variety of concepts and theories that attempt to explain their impact on contemporary sociteties, states, and individuals. Multiculturalism cannot be fully understood in isolation from globalisation. In today’s rapidly changing world shaped by globalisation, multiculturalism remains one of the most widely discussed and contested issues—both within academia and in public discourse. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of multiculturalism and globalisation, offering knowledge that is valuable for both research and professional careers beyond academia. By fostering critical thinking and encouraging creativity, it also aims to broaden students’ perspectives, helping them interpret today’s globalised world, address its challanges, and anticipate the near future in a more insightful and enriched way.",
      "description": "In the opening weeks, the course will address the topics of multiculturalism and globalisation separately, equipping students with a foundational understanding of these two phenomena. This will be followed by a week dedicated to key theories of multiculturalism and globalisation. In the subsequent weeks, the course will explore the relationship between multiculturalism and globalisation in the context of phenomena such as migration, global inequalities, and populism. In the concluding weeks, attention will turn to the challenges and future prospects of multiculturalism and globalisation, concluding with student presentations.",

We will consider gender as a constitutive element of identity and by analyzing its intersection with other categories such as race, class, nation and sexuality, we will grasp the importance of the representation of gender in media and its meaning for our lives. The course consists of lectures, screenings and discussions revolving around critical analysis of and engagement with contemporary examples of film, television, adverts and new media.",
      "description": "his course examines various images and representations of gender in media paying particular attention to contemporary discussions. Employing theories from cultural studies, media, film, reception and gender studies, it explores different processes and practices of gender, specifically in terms of media representations of femininity, masculinity and queerness. The media plays a major role in \"constructing\" gender, and “popular” views of what appropriate gendering is, in turn, shape how we communicate with each other. Participation (20%) – You should come to class prepared to ask questions and ready to make lively, insightful, substantive and respectful contributions to our discussion of the course materials. Written Assignment (20%): These assignments require the students to select a theme we have covered in the class and conduct a detailed analysis of how that example reflects the context in which it was produced/distributed/exhibited.",

      "objectives": "This course is designed to introduce students with the development of human rights as a global phenomenon, an international legal regime transgressing state borders. Our aim is to explore certain questions pertaining to human rights: What is it that we call “human rights”? In what historical periods can we locate progress and expansion in human rights? What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.",
      "description": "Our course will proceed on the basis of three parts. In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities.",

Over time they have given rise to a variety of concepts and theories that attempt to explain their impact on contemporary sociteties, states, and individuals. Multiculturalism cannot be fully understood in isolation from globalisation. In today’s rapidly changing world shaped by globalisation, multiculturalism remains one of the most widely discussed and contested issues—both within academia and in public discourse. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of multiculturalism and globalisation, offering knowledge that is valuable for both research and professional careers beyond academia. By fostering critical thinking and encouraging creativity, it also aims to broaden students’ perspectives, helping them interpret today’s globalised world, address its challanges, and anticipate the near future in a more insightful and enriched way.",
          "description": "In the opening weeks, the course will address the topics of multiculturalism and globalisation separately, equipping students with a foundational understanding of these two phenomena. This will be followed by a week dedicated to key theories of multiculturalism and globalisation. In the subsequent weeks, the course will explore the relationship between multiculturalism and globalisation in the context of phenomena such as migration, global inequalities, and populism. In the concluding weeks, attention will turn to the challenges and future prospects of multiculturalism and globalisation, concluding with student presentations.",

We will consider gender as a constitutive element of identity and by analyzing its intersection with other categories such as race, class, nation and sexuality, we will grasp the importance of the representation of gender in media and its meaning for our lives. The course consists of lectures, screenings and discussions revolving around critical analysis of and engagement with contemporary examples of film, television, adverts and new media.",
          "description": "his course examines various images and representations of gender in media paying particular attention to contemporary discussions. Employing theories from cultural studies, media, film, reception and gender studies, it explores different processes and practices of gender, specifically in terms of media representations of femininity, masculinity and queerness. The media plays a major role in \"constructing\" gender, and “popular” views of what appropriate gendering is, in turn, shape how we communicate with each other. Participation (20%) – You should come to class prepared to ask questions and ready to make lively, insightful, substantive and respectful contributions to our discussion of the course materials. Written Assignment (20%): These assignments require the students to select a theme we have covered in the class and conduct a detailed analysis of how that example reflects the context in which it was produced/distributed/exhibited.",

          "objectives": "This course is designed to introduce students with the development of human rights as a global phenomenon, an international legal regime transgressing state borders. Our aim is to explore certain questions pertaining to human rights: What is it that we call “human rights”? In what historical periods can we locate progress and expansion in human rights? What do human rights stand for/against? What does it mean to have human rights with a claim to universality? By giving priority to primary texts and documents on human rights, we will try to understand this historical, legal, and political concept both in theory and practice.",
          "description": "Our course will proceed on the basis of three parts. In the first part, we will have a general introduction to the course, and will read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 adopted by the United Nations. In this part, we will also spend time on a broad yet somewhat nuanced enough trajectory of human rights. In so doing, we will try to diagnose and shed light upon certain keystones, radical shifts, and arguably progressive moments in historical development of conceptual, political and legal articulations of human rights. In the second part, we will focus on the early 20th century developments on human rights; such as the two world wars, the Nuremberg Trials, and the international recognition of “crimes against humanity” and genocide. We will spare our last few weeks on the decolonization period onwards. In this part we will discuss issues such as right to self-determination, child labor, migrant workers, and rights of persons with disabilities.",

Massive-scale expansion of urban areas; irreversible processes of deforestation and environmental degradation caused by the idea of \"infinite growth\"; careless urbanization and suburbanization; local and global threats posed by the climate change; and transnational impacts of changing public consumption habits into blind consumerism; all of these developments in the past few centuries address that in our age, the human-nature relationship takes place in the form of an \"ecological crisis,\" meaning the time for taking significant steps towards rethinking of this relationship. In this respect, this course offers students to comprehend various issues of politics of environment from the perspective of \"planetary thinking,\" which acknowledges contributions of conventional approaches; but it also brings a new approach by studying \"human life\" and \"human health\" in relation to planetary health that includes animal health, environmental/ecological health, and biodiversity.",
      "description": "This course will develop in three parts. In the first part, we are going to spend some time in understanding the “ecological crisis” by looking at its symptoms and reasons, also climate denialism, and the idea of “planetary thinking” and “planetary health.” In the second part, we are going to elaborate on the critical perspectives towards the idea of environmental justice with an emphasis on green philosophy and politics as well as international cooperation on sustainability and ecological enhancement. We will devote the final part of the course on current debates.",

          "objectives": "This course aims to introduce key issues, major themes, and pressing problems concerning environmental politics and ecological thinking. Massive-scale expansion of urban areas; irreversible processes of deforestation and environmental degradation caused by the idea of \"infinite growth\"; careless urbanization and suburbanization; local and global threats posed by the climate change; and transnational impacts of changing public consumption habits into blind consumerism; all of these developments in the past few centuries address that in our age, the human-nature relationship takes place in the form of an \"ecological crisis,\" meaning the time for taking significant steps towards rethinking of this relationship. In this respect, this course offers students to comprehend various issues of politics of environment from the perspective of \"planetary thinking,\" which acknowledges contributions of conventional approaches; but it also brings a new approach by studying \"human life\" and \"human health\" in relation to planetary health that includes animal health, environmental/ecological health, and biodiversity.",
          "description": "This course will develop in three parts. In the first part, we are going to spend some time in understanding the “ecological crisis” by looking at its symptoms and reasons, also climate denialism, and the idea of “planetary thinking” and “planetary health.” In the second part, we are going to elaborate on the critical perspectives towards the idea of environmental justice with an emphasis on green philosophy and politics as well as international cooperation on sustainability and ecological enhancement. We will devote the final part of the course on current debates.",

          "description": "This course is one of the basic sections of Operations Research, which studies a rational process for selecting the best of several alternatives. The “goodness” of a selected alternative depends on the quality of the data used in describing the decision situation. From this standpoint, a decisionmaking process can fall into one of three categories. 1. Decisionmaking under uncertainty in which the data cannot be assigned relative weights that represent their degree of relevance in the decision process. 2. Decisionmaking under risk in which the data can be described by probability distributions. 3. Decisionmaking under certainty in which the data are known deterministically. 4. Decision making in multicriteria environment. The main subjects of the course are the decision situation, decision rule, decision trees, information and the cost of additional information, utility theory, multiobjective problems, solution notions for such problems and methods for calculations efficient solutions for multiobjective problems, goal programming and the methods of analyzing solutions for goal programming problems.",

The Ottoman era - from its beginning, showing various influences such as Persian Selcuk and Byzantine - up to the effective dissolution of the empire including late court artistic expressions. The Modernist period - examining the influence of internationalist styles in the 19th and 20th centuries from the development of a Turkish impressionist movement, through the republican period and up to the late formalism of the 60s and 70s. The contemporary period - examining the advent of conceptual art in Turkey, the development of contemporary art institutions and the manner in which major contemporary issues have influenced current art practice in Turkey.",

          "description": "The course will focus on three phases of Turkish culture. The Ottoman era - from its beginning, showing various influences such as Persian Selcuk and Byzantine - up to the effective dissolution of the empire including late court artistic expressions. The Modernist period - examining the influence of internationalist styles in the 19th and 20th centuries from the development of a Turkish impressionist movement, through the republican period and up to the late formalism of the 60s and 70s. The contemporary period - examining the advent of conceptual art in Turkey, the development of contemporary art institutions and the manner in which major contemporary issues have influenced current art practice in Turkey.",
